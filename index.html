              Charitable work and philanthropy have long been an Abraham family affair. A founding member of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, her father set a shining example for Norma Jean and the whole family to follow. For over the past 30 years, Norma Jean has been active in non-profit organizations including the Alonzo Mourning Charities, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Cancer Link, Children’s Home Society, Miami City Ballet, Food for Life, The Overtown Youth Center, Mother’s Voices, Children’s Village Boystown, Learning Leadership program at St. John Bosco, Special Olympics, City Year, and the Rene Moawad Foundation which promotes peace & stability in her native Lebanon.<br><br>

              Norma Jean has received numerous awards over the years. She has been named an Honorary Trustee by Miami Light Project, a “Woman of Valor” by Children’s Home Society, and has been specially honored by Alonzo Mourning Charities with the “Helping Hands” award at Zo’s Summer Groove. She has received Bank of America’s “Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Award” for being a local hero, and “The Ethel & W. George Kennedy Family Foundation Volunteerism Award” at The American Red Cross of Miami Dade’s Spectrum Awards for all of her continuous hands-on work in our community. She has also received Barry University’s Celebration of the Human Spirit “Laudare Medal” for extraordinary service to the community as a champion for families and children through support of education, and she was also recognized in 2011 as a Woman of Distinction and Caring by the Plaza Health Network. <br><br>

              To say that Norma Jean is active in the community would be an understatement. She has just wrapped up her four-year stretch as co-chair of Big Brothers Big Sisters annual “Miracle Makers” Fashion Show while continuing on to her third year as chair of Zoo Miami’s “Feast With The Beasts” event. She is on the committee of many other charitable events throughout the year, and continues to maintain her role as part of Honey Shine Mentoring Programs annual “Hat’s Off” Luncheon. <br><br>

              Norma Jean also sits on the Board of Directors of the Zoological Society of Florida, is a long time member of the Women’s Committee of Big Brothers Big Sisters and has served on the Board of Honey Shine Mentoring Program since its inception. She has dedicated the past nine years to helping teens and mentoring young girls. She continues to devote weeks of her time to Honey Shine Mentoring Program’s summer camp, not to mention her participation in the bi-monthly workshops! “Everyone has a purpose in life,” she adds, “I’m blessed to have found mine.”  She looks forward to continuing to serve the South Florida community for years to come—with her smart, sweet, Schnauzer pup “Snugs” at her side.
